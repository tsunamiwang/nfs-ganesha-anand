If you wish to compile the Ceph FSAL, you will need to install some pre-requisites.

On RedHat derived distributions, do:

yum install libatomic_ops-devel fuse-devel gperftools-devel libedit-devel \
      boost-devel libaio-devel cryptopp-devel

On Debian derived distributions, do:

aptitude install libatomic-ops-dev libfuse-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev \
      libedit-dev libboost-all-dev libaio-dev libcrypto++-dev

Then run ./ceph.sh

This script assumes that sudo is installed for the make install pass.
