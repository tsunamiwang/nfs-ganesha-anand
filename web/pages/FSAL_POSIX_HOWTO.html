<h1>Exporting a POSIX filesystem with GANESHA</h1>

<P>

Ganesha works with any typical Unix filesystem using the "POSIX" FSAL
(File System Abstraction Layer) dynamically loadable library -- libfsalposix.so.

<P>

There is a slight performance penalty paid for this portability --
possibly 30% -- when compared to using a filesystem like Linux VFS. This
is because the "VFS" FSAL exploits native support for "reverse-lookups" of
NFS handles.

<P>

However, no compromises were made implementing the POSIX FSAL. For
instance the POSIX FSAL does not cause handles to become stale if the
ganesha process dies or even if your NFS server reboots.

<P>

Any path on the local filesystem can be exported. Even a path that
has multiple different mounts can be exported. For instance if you
have a number of directories,

<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/mnt/cdrom
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/mnt/usb-drive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/mnt/my-windows-C:-drive

<P>

you can merely export /mnt/ and ganesha is designed to work as expected.

<P>
For an example configuration see:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src/config_samples/posix.ganesha.nfsd.conf
<P>
<P>

Note that previous releases of ganesha required an SQL database install
and setup. This is no longer required since the POSIX FSAL performs all
persistence using its own internal custom database /var/tmp/nfs-ganesha-posix.fdb.

<P>

A background ganesha process will be automatically started to manage
this database. It will always be running and should not be stopped
unless ganesha is upgraded to a newer version. It requires no
configuration.

<P>

To be fast /var/tmp/nfs-ganesha-posix.fdb stores only a <I>minimal</I>
amount of information necessary to reconstruct handles. It only requires
this information if both ganesha processes restart, such as after a
reboot.

<P>

This has some performance consequences after rebooting if you happen to
have a directory with a large number of files. The POSIX FSAL will need
to read the entire directory if it needs to access even one file in that
directory. Fortunately this will happen only once.
