<h2 class="welcome">NFS-Ganesha</h2>

<p>NFS-GANESHA is a NFS server running in User Space. &nbsp;It is available under the <a href="http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html">CeCILL</a> license, which is a French transposition of the GPL&nbsp; and is fully GPL-compatible.</p>
 <p>It has been designed to meet two goals:<br><ul><li>providing very large metadata and data caches (up to millions of records)</li><li>providing
NFS exports to various files systems and namespaces (a set of data
organized as trees, with a structure similar to a files system)</li></ul>
</p>

<p> NFS-GANESHA uses dedicated backend modules called FSAL (which stand for File System
Abstraction Layer) that provided the product with a unique API (used
internally) to access the underlying namespace. The FSAL module is
basically the "glue" between the namespace and the other part of
NFS-GANESHA</p>
<p>Available FSALs are:<br>
<ul>
	<li>FSAL/POSIX: this module is based on the well known POSIX API which is included in the
LibC. It allows NFS export for anything accessible via the POSIX
interface. POSIX API addresses files and directories by their names
(which are volatile identifiers, they may change if object is renamed).
FSAL API uses persistent, opaque, unique identifier called handles.
Because a this, FSAL/POSIX use the service of an internal persistent database to
perform "reverse lookup" from handle to filename.</li>
	<li>FSAL/SNMP:
information available via SNMP are organized as trees, they constitute
a namespace. This backend module provides with the capability to export
SNMP information data via NFS and browse them in a "procfs-like" way.</li>
	<li>FSAL/PROXY:
the module is in fact a NFSv4 client. Used with NFS-GANESHA, it turns
the NFS server into a NFS proxy server. This module is still in its
alpha version</li>
	<li>FSAL/FUSELIKE: many product use FUSE to have NFS
export. Often they resided in the user space. NFS-GANESHA is in user
space too, and via this module it allow user space product to have NFS
export from user space, without explicit kernel communication. The
module use the same interface as the classical fuse binding: if your
application have a fuse binding module ready, you'll need nothing else
to interface it with NFS-GANESHA. For this specific use, the
NFS-GANESHA's engine is wrap in a library to be use and compile with
your proprieritary application.</li></p>
