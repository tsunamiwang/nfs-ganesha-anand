Adding a documentation page:
----------------------------

- go to the "pages" subdirectory
- copy the "template.html" file to a new file (for exemple "toto.html")
- Edit "toto.html" the way you want (using a text or html editor)
- To create a link to "toto.html" in the documentation menu,
  edit "doc.html" with a text editor, copy an existing line
  and:
	- in the "href" property, change "page=..." to "page=toto"
	- write the text you want to appear in the link
- That's all!

Publishing the web site:
------------------------
Copy all the files and directories (except this README)
to the "htdocs" directory of the project.
